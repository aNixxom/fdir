        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Our agency was founded on the belife that every american has a right to 
        his or hers data online. The main goal of our agency is to stop the tech compainies like
        Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and so much more from stealing and using your data against you. 
        We aim to do this task starting by passing the <u>21st Century Regulation of Information Technology Act</u>. Gettings this
        bill passed into law will allow the FDIR to take actions against the companies who use the everyday american for their own
        financial gains. One way we will achive this is by require all tech compainies to submit a copy of their TOS (Terms of Server) to the
        FDIR (Federal Department of Internet Regulation) in order for us to review them. If we find anything out of place or unfair 
        for the user it will then be our mission to find the people responsibe and give them what they desever, weather it be jail time,
        or a fine of up to 200% of that compainies annual incom. We will also aim to provie a safer and less censored enviromenet of the
        people of the United States. As well as require companies to follow more internet regulation guidlines.</p>
